nn_address TYPO3 v7 compatibility Update by Markus Timtner (markus@timtner.de )

This Branch is dedicated to the v7 compatibility of nn_address - it seems to work so far, any feedback welcome.

Breaking Changes:
I'm afraid that extending the fields via flexform won't work anymore -
I didn't use this feature at all and I prefer the standard T3 way of Extending the Database.
